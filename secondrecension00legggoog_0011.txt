PREFA TOR Υ NOTE. vii

other editions used have been collated with the proofs by means
of copies in public libraries or in my own possession. It
will be obserx'red that the variants in the several editions are

small, and of little importance. But this ungrateful labour
had to be undertaken if the facts were to be made out.

The following editions are those which have been collated for
the present reprint 3 and the symbols used incollation are given
at the headof each title. 49, it should be noted, has only been
collated as far as the beginning of the psalter. 60 is only a.

pars hyemalis, and so only the winter part of the breviary has

been collated. 42 is a Quignon diurnale containing no part of
Mattius.
