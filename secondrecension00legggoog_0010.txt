PREFATORY NOTE.

doubt arise as to the word intended. To avoid a great increase
of bulk, the psalms and scripture lessons have not been reprinted
entire. Only the beginning and ending of these have been
given. The number of each psalm always appears in the
heading3 and for the lessons a reference to the Vulgate is added
in a footnote. The rest of the breviary has been reprinted in
full ; so that the Vulgate is the only additional book needful as
a companion to this edition.

The editions collated for this work have been chosen on no
very definite principle save that of accessibility. With charac-
teristic generosity the Rev. W. J. Blew gave me access to those
editions which belonged to his rich liturgical library. *Others
have been found amongst my own books, As many as twelve
editions have been collated. 2The year of the century in which
the book appeared has been taken for the symbol of the edition.

1538, and so on.

When etc. has been added after the symbol of an edition it
usually means that all the editions used for collation following
after the date of the edition named have the same reading.
With this exception, be it noted, that “ 61, etc.,” means a small
group of editions printed at Antwerp, beginning with an edition
of the Plantin press in 1557, in which there is, besides arguments
to the psalmS, an index to the epistles and gospels read in
the mass: for this work this index has been neglected. The
symbol “61 etc.,’' thus indicates a collation of 61, 64, and 66,
and appears chiefly in the psalter for the arguments to the
psalmS.

The collation for this edition was made many years ago,
before the dispersal of the library of our late Vice-President‚
Mr. Blew ; so that it has not been possible to collate afresh with
the proofs of the present reprint the readings given from Mr.
Blew’s bookS‚ of which more particularly the copies indicated by
,the symbols 38‚41, and 66 may be named. But the variants of the
