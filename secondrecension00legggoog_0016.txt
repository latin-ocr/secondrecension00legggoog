⁴ Here and there an edition ha's been quoted for one particular
point. In this the date, stationer, and place of publication have
been given with the note.

To distinguish between the two recensions Ι still think the
simplest and easiest method is merely to look at the first words
of the prefatory letter of Cardinal Quignon to Pope Paul 111.
Those of the first recension are Cogitanti mihi pater sanctissimel ;
os the second, Breviart'um Romanum nuper a nobis.

Itis hoped that in a succeeding volume something may be
said of the history of the Quignon Breviary‚ the sources whence
it was derived, and the* influence which it had on liturgy in the
sixteenth century. ⁵

Ι have now only to thank those who have given me help in
propat-ing this edition; especially the heads os the libraries in
different parts of Europe, from whom Ι have always received
great courtesy and attention. Their number is so great that Ι
find it difficult to enumerate them ; but Ι am not the less
grateful for the kindness that Ι havereceived at their hands,
The reader may gain some imperfect idea of the extent os my
obligations is he cast a glance at the Handlist os Editions which
follows this note. And Ἰ would add some expression os
gratitude also to the founders os these libraries at home and
abroad, to whose exertions in the long forgotten past we owe
the means of pursuing those studies which are to many of us a
source- of the most unfeigned delight.
